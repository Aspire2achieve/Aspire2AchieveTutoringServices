We work together on the skills that they need in both Verbal and Non-Verbal reasoning, skills that are invaluable as they begin their journey into secondary education. By providing this support they will become familiar with the types of questions that are asked and grow in confidence in readiness for the entry exams for year 6 pupils in September of each year.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Working with children in primary schools is pre-dominantly for me about building their confidence in the key skills that they are developing while at school. It is about building on the work that they are doing and nurturing them in their enjoyment of learning. Often for this age group they need reinforcement of basics which will help them throughout their education. With the support of you as parents, I aim to identify any gaps in their basic understanding and work with the children to build their knowledge and give them the confidence to learn and grow.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">At this stage, I focus on numeracy for pupils in KS3. These years are important for children to build on the knowledge and understanding that they have before embarking on GSCEâ€™s. It is crucial that children have solid foundations in mathematics to enable them to have the confidence to try the wide ranging topics that they will experience. We will work together to ensure the foundations are secure but perhaps more importantly my focus is always on giving children  belief in themselves and their ability to reach their potential. Maths is as much about confidence as it is about knowledge!</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Helping young people achieve their potential at GCSE maths requires many things. I have the experience and qualifications to share my knowledge of maths with them as well as an understanding of the examinations and syllabus for the main boards which allows me to focus on techniques where necessary. I truly believe however that what tutoring provides is not only the time to really understand the individual needs of every young person but also the opportunity to allow them to aspire to achieve more than they think they are capable of. As your child takes their examination I aim to ensure they have the skills and confidence to achieve their very best. </p>
